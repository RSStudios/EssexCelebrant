<section class="inner-6em funerals">
    <div>Funerals are the one sure thing in life. </div>
    <div>Yet it is something that many of us rarely speak about - let alone plan for.</div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Do you know what your options are?
        </li>
        <li>Who makes the decisions?</li>
    </ul>
    <div>What ever your choice, make sure it is one that you have made and not someone else.</div>
    <div>We often believe that our only choice is to have a minister and that it has to be in a church or crematorium.</div>
    <div>Today, there are many options.  Celebrations can be held at home or in a green burial ground.  There is no rush.  Your loved one is not going anywhere and for those left behind the decision made is important.</div>
    <div>Who can you talk to?</div>
    <div>A funeral director is a very good place to start.</div>
    <div>However, other options are a minister, independent celebrant or humanist.</div>
    <div>A funeral director will guide you as to what each is able to offer.  If you and your family want a non religious ceremony, maybe a minister is not the best option for your.  However, do you want the other end of the spectrum where no religion is allowed.</div>
    <div>Many of our clients say that they or their loved one never went to church, yet they would like “The lords Prayer”.  This is your celebration of life - not anyone else’s.  You need to do what you are comfortable with.</div>
    <div>Funeral directors often only use selected ministers, celebrants or humanists.  Ask Mr Google and make your own choice.  Ask for recommendations from friends.</div>
    <div>Even ask to speak to a couple of celebrants before choosing.  Like many important events in your life, you only get one chance.</div>
    <div>We are happy to talk to you without obligation - at the funeral directors or your home.</div>
    <div>Call us for an initial chat. </div>
    <div>We are here to help.</div>
