            Other things to consider:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Always interview two or even three potential toastmasters - after all you are entrusting them with the smooth running of the most important day of your life to date; your wedding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't simply be guided by price. Ask what is included in a wedding package.
            </li>
            <li>Be aware that some venues include "Toastmaster" services. Often this is the Events Manager or Front of House Manager. They will not be dedicated to Toastmastering your wedding breakfast or evening function. Please check.</li>
        </ul>
