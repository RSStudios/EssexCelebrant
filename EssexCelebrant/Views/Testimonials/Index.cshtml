                        <p>I simply wanted to write on behalf of all my Chief Officer colleagues to thank you for the important part you personally played in organising the ACTION Awards Dinner 2007.</p>
                        <p>This was the 4th such Awards dinner and I have been privileged to have been involved in the planning of all of them.  Without a doubt this was the best yet; not only my view but also that of a number of other people who had attended previous dinners.  I think that I managed to speak to just about everyone at the dinner last night and our staff and their partners and friends were clearly immensely impressed.  It was noticeable that one or two people who were slightly sceptical at the start were very positive indeed by the end of the evening.</p>
                        <p>These events do not happen of their own accord and I am only too aware that an immense amount of hard work went into last night's dinner.  I am extremely proud of all our award winners; I am equally proud of the work that you did to enable us as a Force to congratulate them in the way that I think they deserved.</p>

                        <p>
                            Rather belatedly, but nevertheless most sincerely, I should like to take this opportunity to thank you for the excellent and most professional service which you provided as Toastmaster/Master of ceremonies on the occasion of my 60th Birthday Party held on 21st January 2006 at the Five Lakes Resort
                        </p>
                        <p>Your involvement ensured that the entire evening proceeded most smoothly and I should especially like to thank you for being on hand during the discussions held with the hotel's Event Manager over the misunderstanding of the number of desserts which I had ordered for each guest.</p>
                        <p>As a result of your input, the event Manager admitted on behalf of the hotel that an error had occurred on its part and you were in a position to put at ease those guests who were at risk of not getting a dessert. As you are aware, the issue was resolved satisfactorily to the extent that every guest subsequently appeared to be replete although, needless to say, as I write no formal apology, or indeed recompense, has been forthcoming from the hotel.</p>
                        <p>
                            Since the party, I have received a number of comments, all favourable, from my oldest friends and erstwhile colleagues as to the professionalism which you displayed and I felt that you reached exactly the correct degree of formality required to match the occasion.
                        </p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, it goes without saying, of course, that I would have no hesitation in recommending your services.</p>
                        <p>Once again, with my belated thanks and kind regards,</p>

                            Now that the dust has settled and we are back from a few days away, we wanted to write and thank you so much for the excellent job you did at Sarah and Dan's wedding.
                            The day went so smoothly and the "breakfast" worked like clockwork, due in no small measure to your expert handling. The speeches were all just long enough and there were just the
                            right number of toasts to prevent us jumping up and down like yo-yos1! We did so appreciate your telling mother not to try and get up for them and she was most grateful.

                        <p> We hope Carlie enjoyed the day, too. It must be difficult for her at these occasions as the chances are she won't know many people, if any. At least, she got fed this time!</p>
                        <p>Very many thanks once again for a splendid job, very well done. We will certainly recommend you to anyone who asks!</p>
