    </p>
    <p>Funeral conducted by </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a minister in a church</li>

        A local Funeral Director will guide you in organising a funeral for a loved one.
    </p>
    <p>
        They will ensure that all the legal paperwork is completed and anything else you require.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can organise everything yourself – however, this can be difficult as you too are grieving.
    </p>

<script class="answer answer3" type="text/template">
    <p>
        You do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Funeral Director should give you the names of those who can conduct your funeral, whether that is a minister, Humanist or Independent Celebrant.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want a particular person, you can – just ask.
    </p>
    <p>
        Search of google if you are not sure.
    </p>

    <p>
        No.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can have who you would like.  Minister, Humanist or Independent Celebrant.
    </p>

    <p>
        A Humanist Celebrant cannot include anything in your service that is of a religious nature.  This includes hymns, songs, poems or prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
        An Independent Celebrant is able to include whatever you and your family want for the funeral celebration.  If you wish to include any religious aspects such as songs, hymns, poems and prayers, you can.
    </p>
    <p>
        Neither a Humanist or Independent Celebrant can conduct a funeral ceremony in a place of worship and do any religious blessing as they are not ordained in any church.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any doubts, please ask.

    <p>
        An Independent Celebrant can provide you with a unique celebration of your relative’s life.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only bias they have will be yours.
    </p>
    <p>
        They only work for you.  No one else.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is your celebration – your way.
    </p>
    <p>
        An Independent Celebrant aims to capture the life of your loved one in a unique way.  They were unique – their funeral is unique.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your ceremony.  Your way.
