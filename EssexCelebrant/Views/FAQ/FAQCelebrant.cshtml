    <p>
        An independent celebrant can make your day personal to you and your partner in the place or venue that is special to you.
    </p>
    <p>The legal aspect can be done earlier and is not necessary to make your day how you have dreamed it to be. </p>
    
</script>
<script class="answer answer2" type="text/template">
    <p>
        No.  Your ceremony can be secular, atheist, religious, modern or traditional - combinations where you wish.   The ceremony is yours to determine.  A humanist ceremony does not allow anything religious within the ceremony, such as songs, hymns or prayers.
    </p>

<script class="answer answer3" type="text/template">
    <p>
        No.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a celebrant led ceremony the legal registering of your marriage would be done separately.  Guidance can be given with this element.
    </p>
    <p>
        A wedding is split into two main parts. .
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal and the ceremonial or traditional.
    </p>
    <p> In england this would be</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a church – signing of the church register (2 witnesses)</li>
        <li>At the civil registry office – signing of the civil register (2 witnesses)</li>
        <li>At a wedding venue – signing the civil register with a Registrar present (2 witnesses) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The legal aspect of the wedding ceremony is often substituted for the traditional elements many want and provides the focus of the ceremony rather than what its true meaning is.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also a legal requirement a civil wedding at a venue MUST be held under a permanent structure.  This means that outdoor weddings are often with your guests in the sunshine and you under a canopy of some description.
    </p>

<script class="answer answer4" type="text/template">
    <p>
        The ceremonial or traditional elements are whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        This could be
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>  vows personal to you.</li>
        <li> wearing of traditional ceremonial regalia</li>
        <li> following certain ceremonial rituals</li>
        <li> donning a beautiful white gown</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        This is the symbolic part of a ceremony that is personal to you and your partner.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the essence of who you are as a couple and the start of your life together.
    </p>
